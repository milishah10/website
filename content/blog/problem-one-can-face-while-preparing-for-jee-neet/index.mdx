In India, Competitive exams are like Unskippable YouTube ads. You like it or not one should have to give it. After 12th science, there are so many exams students have to face as like the JEE test series for engineering and NEET test series for Medical and many more.
90% of students face some realistic problems during these exams which one can easily ignore and which increase students mental pressure and will end up affecting their education. So here we are focusing on some unfocused problems which students face during preparing for JEE test series or NEET test series.

## Lack of Choices

No, I am not saying there are so fewer options to choose after 12th. I am talking about the options students are allowed to choose. As after 10th, it’s shameful to choose arts and at some extent commerce also. We have all three options science, commerce, and arts but we are allowed to choose from science and commerce only. The same way one can’t choose other than IT, Civil or mechanical engineering or MBBS, Pharma, etc. just because of pressure from parents, relatives or society. You can feel proud of Dhoni or Virat Kholi for being one of the best cricketers but can’t let your child choose the cricket over JEE or NEET. One should allow choosing his/ her career path according to his/her interest. Sharp their interest don’t force it.

## Lack of Guidance

To get proper guidance for NEET/JEE After deciding to build your career in engineering or medical is so much difficult. How to balance preparation for boards and JEE/NEET test series simultaneously, when to start, where to go, how to start, how many hours to spent everything to get a proper mentor for this is so difficult, because everyone has so much to say according to their experience. Everyone is right in their way but that doesn’t mean everything suits you perfectly. Choose your mentor wisely and listen to him/her with extra attention.

## Lack of discipline

“Level discipline can decide the Level of Success”. Most Common problem of students is they took advantage of the stuff they have. As an example, if they have time for 3 months to prepare for competitive exams like JEE test series or NEET test series, 90% of students will waste get serious about it when they are left with just a month. Success is not a magic wand that you wave it and get it. It will take proper discipline, proper guidance, dedicated time table and lots of sacrifices. Be prepared for that one first and get yourself in the shape of discipline for the exams.

## Distraction

One should know their limits. Limits of spending time reading other books, reading the newspaper, being on social media, playing games, spending time with family and friends, spending time on your interest while preparing for JEE test series or NEET test series. It’s good to stay connected or Get/give Updates from around the globe or reading about others success story but you should know when it’s becoming your distraction. Do everything but in schedule time. Keep your goal realistic. Getting inspired by reading success stories is a good thing but keep in mind be ready to give everything that it takes. One can’t just crack JEE/NEET while being on social media all day.

## Peer Pressure

Be You. Getting things done because he/she is doing and expecting the same results is foolishness. You should do what is best for you. Your friend is going for this JEE test series coaching class for extra classes I also wanted to do that that won’t work. maybe you are talented enough that you don’t even need the extra class. Society will say something every time. It's your call to listen to yourself or your child. Don’t compare yourself or your child to others because everyone is different in their way just as the Rancho, Raju, and Farhan from 3 idiots. Despite being in the same college and best friends their core of interest wasn’t the same. Don’t get pressurized by people and Just trust yourself or your Child.

## Too Much Professionalism

Being professional is a nice thing. But using an education system the way of earing only is not good. Being a teacher it’s a responsibility to guide a student in the right way. Nowadays JEE test series/ NEET test series coaching centers are becoming more professional in spite of focusing on studies or a future of students they just focus on how to make more money. I am not saying that every coaching center is a fraud but yes this is happing because of this, students are getting more pressurized. Extra money for the extra class, extra money for late entries, extra money for this and that. Someone's future is depending on the way you treat or the way you educate them. Take this responsibility wisely.

## Procrastinating the Chapter

We all find some chapter or subject difficult so instant decision we will make is to do it later on. Don't do that get done with that at that time only. It's now or never situation. Focus on it get the help you need, search on the internet for the solution and end it. Waiting for the time will just disturb the schedule and break the time table and distract you from focusing on the other chapters. You will get stressed about it until you will get rid of it. So why not now? Do it solve it and keep it aside.

These are some of the problems one can face before or during preparing for JEE test series or NEET test series. Give attention to them try finding the best possible way to solve them and you can achieve the best possible results you opt for. Just try to be as relax and focused towards your goal to clear JEE/NEET. You can be in your dream college but this will take so much of dedication so just be serious about it. Wishing you all the readers all the best for your JEE test series or NEET test series.
